Crews are expected to try to remove the blowout preventer on BP's ruptured well in the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday, said Thad Allen, the government's point man on the oil disaster.

But first, crews must pull a capping stack on top of the ruptured well, which was used to help seal it. The cap is expected to be off Thursday afternoon.

Officials plan to detach the blowout preventer from the well and replace it with a new one, a procedure aimed at paving the way for a final fix. But the effort to permanently seal the ruptured oil well has stalled because of turbulent seas.

"We've run into a weather window that's got us in a hold," Allen said. "If we can get to the blowout preventer sooner rather than later, we will do that."

BP announced the postponement of the procedure on its Twitter page Monday. Seas are starting to calm in the Gulf, but may have eased enough until Friday or sometime during the weekend, Allen said.

Waves of approximately four feet or less would be necessary for the work to resume, according to Allen.

He had warned last week that changes in weather could result in a change in schedule. Last week, the operation was delayed as engineers tried to fish out pieces of drill pipe stuck inside the blowout preventer.

Removal of the device will need to be done carefully, as the blowout preventer may hold valuable forensic evidence as to why it failed on April 20, triggering the explosion that killed 11 rig workers and caused the massive oil spill.

Allen said teams are working closely with joint investigation groups, engineers, scientists and the Department of Justice to ensure the machinery is handled correctly.

The well has been capped since July 15, and no new oil is flowing into the Gulf.
